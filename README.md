# Smart Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project developed for analyzing energy efficiency, carbon emissions, and housing parameters in the UK. The report is titled **"SA_Final.pbix"**.

## Project Overview

The dashboard provides interactive visualizations to explore relationships between:

- **Property Type**
- **Tenure**
- **CO2 Emissions**
- **Energy Efficiency Ratings**
- **UK Regional Locations**

The main goals of this dashboard are:
- To visualize CO2 emissions across UK regions and property types.
- To analyze energy efficiency trends over time.
- To explore multi-dimensional relationships among key housing variables.
